/**
 * Asset pipeline manifest file for the Planio 2 "light" stylesheet
 *
 * require application <- this does unfortunately not work, broken image paths.
 * to make it work we would need to refactor core application.css to use sprockets
 * helpers for paths
 *
 * The theme CSS, imports main application.css using sass asset-path helper:
 *= require flatly_light/stylesheets/flatly_light
